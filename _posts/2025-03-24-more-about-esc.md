So last night I found [this video](https://youtu.be/8LXPcJD6hEA?si=CDZh7bLm7wNlaAXb) looks like it could help me get something going. However it is quite the massive design he got going there, this lead me into looking at the HGLRC Specter 60A ESC 3-6S BL_S for FPV Racing Drone Freestyle, which is a 4 in 1, commercial ESC controller. What I was most curious about is how they deal with such massive currents in a PCB. This thing might be incredibly thick from the inside to run super thick lanes but still unsure how it works. However, what I did learn from that was the N-Channel MOSFET it uses. It uses the QN3109M6N which can handle 30V and 154A at 25C. It uses a proximately 24 of those. Well, commercial grade are interesting to see how small this can get, but that aside. Another point I saw from the DIY video was that you need a gate driver for each of them. And after looking more into it the QN3109M6N also seems to require 10V to get the 154A. Well, I'll need to research and get the appropriate equipment over time. This little morning research was fun, will look into making dev board to get a feel for PCB making before going all in to this.
